            <p>My middle school was located on the second story of my city's local art museum. I remember walking through the halls every day in awe, catching glimpses of curators and exhibition designers working on the next installation, and watching guest artists paint murals around me. Museums are deeply ingrained in me. So much so that I decided to make a career out of it! I am a student in Pratt Institute's Museums and Digital Culture program and couldn't be more excited to join the field.</p>
            <p>When I'm not writing case studies or wandering around New York City's museums, you can find me rummaging through the dollar bin at record stores, reading my poetry at open mics, or editing photos.</p>
